# Implement a program that:

# Prompts the user for a level, n. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the
# program should prompt again.

# Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each
# of X and Y is a non-negative integer with n digits. No need to support
# operations other than addition (+).

# Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct
# (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user
# again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the
# user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should
# output the correct answer.

# The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct
# answers out of 10.
